Unshift is so much slower once array reach larger sizes due to it needing to unshift each element in the array and asign it a new index number. Meanwhile push will simply add the new element to the end of the array, not changing any of the existing elements.

Part 2
Space complexity:
SumZero: O(n^2)
UniqueChar: O(n^2)
Pangram: O(1)
LongestWord: O(n)
