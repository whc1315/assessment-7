Analysis:
With the insert function that uses unshift, it starts as a nice quick function. As the array size increases the time grows rapidly, this is due to the fact that when a new item is added to the front all the onld items have to be renumbered in the array. The append function which is using the push method at the lower end does not get its time down as low as the insert, but when given a larger function its time grow is much much smaller. This is due to the fact that it is simply adding a new item to the end of the array and everything else stays the same.

The append function scales much better, in the last test with the extraLargeArray it finally broke 1 millisecond while the insert function was at 773 milliseconds.
